Your website, %s, is undergoing a brute force attack.

There have been at least 4 failed attempts to log in during the past 60 minutes that used one or more of the following components:


Component                    Count     Value from Current Attempt
------------------------     -----     --------------------------------
Network IP                       4     1.2.38
Username                         4     test
Password MD5                     1     %s

The Login Security Solution plugin (%s) for WordPress is repelling the attack by making their login failures take a very long time.

Further notifications about this attacker will only be sent if the attack stops for at least %d minutes and then resumes.
